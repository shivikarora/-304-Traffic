# -304-Traffic
In this paper I analyze the factors increasing the chances of motor vehicle accidents being fatal. Approximately 13,300 people died or sustained serious injuries in Canada in 2010 due to motor vehicle collision related incidents. Are most of these collisions due to driving under influence? Or nighttime visibility? Are the number of traffic accident fatalities increasing or are cars becoming safer? Analyzing a dataset picked from the Open Data Toronto on traffic collisions involving fatalities or seriously injured persons from 2006-2020, we try to find the causes and aggravating factors for such incidents and fatalities.
